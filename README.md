# Rust System Monitor

A simple system monitor using Rust with eframe (egui) and sysinfo.

Checks CPU and memory usage.

A personal tool because I though the default task manager took too much resources and gave too much information while I was playing games.

Probably don't use this for real, there are better alternatives for this niche.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run
```
